swiftMacWarranty, once compiled, is a single swift script for checking warranty status on one or more Mac serial numbers, passed as arguments to the script. If no serial number is passed, it will poll the system it's running on for its own serial number. The software was written primarily to be a swift library for use in other software.

This script is based on pyMacWarranty from https://github.com/pudquick/pyMacWarranty and thus retains the same MIT License from pyMacWarranty:
